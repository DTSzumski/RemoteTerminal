<h2>1.9.0 (2017-05-25)</h2>
<p>
    <b>Added the ability to reconnect a terminal using Ctrl+R after a connection terminates or breaks</b>
</p>
<p>
    The fact that connections can now be re-connected has also motivated me to change the behavior when navigating away from disconnected connections (using the top app bar).<br />
    Until now such connections were deemed not useful anymore and were automatically removed from the connection manager. Thus they didn't appear in the top app bar on the favorites page and the connection page anymore.<br />
    This was changed so that these connections are not automatically removed anymore, they are marked with a red border and have to be closed with the  button in the top app bar.

    <b>A personal message from Stefan Podskubka, the original developer of Remote Terminal:</b>
</p>
<p>
    I'm still getting into the habit of regularly working on Remote Terminal. Because of my limited time I will probably keep updates small for now, with only a single new feature or bugfix for each one, so that the frequency of updates is not too low.<br/>
    If you have a little time please look at the links at the bottom of the changelog for further information about my work on Remote Terminal and how you can help me improve it.
