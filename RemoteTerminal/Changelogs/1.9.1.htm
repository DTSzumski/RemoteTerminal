<h2>1.9.1 (2017-05-29)</h2>
<p>
    <b>Fixed a regression with private key authentication</b>
</p>
<p>
    Since 1.9.0 private key authentication did not work because of a threading issue.<br/>
    The terminal just got stuck at a blank screen with a red border.<br />
    Password and Private Key Agent authentication was not affected by this bug.
