<h2>1.8.2 (2017-03-30)</h2>
<p>
    This update contains an important bugfix that has prevented many users from working with Remote Terminal for some time now.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Fixed incompatibility with OpenSSH servers version 7.2 or later</b>
</p>
<p>
    Connections with OpenSSH servers 7.2 or 7.3 were just not possible because a "data outside the valid range" error message just kept popping up.<br />
    This was fixed by updating the supported Diffie–Hellman group key exchange group sizes for the SSH.NET implementation used in Remote Terminal.
</p>

    <b>Another personal message from Stefan Podskubka, the original developer of Remote Terminal:</b>

    Three years have gone by without any updates to Remote Terminal but for me, this new release is the starting point for future development on the app.<br/>
